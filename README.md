# Genetic Algorithm for Set Cover Problem

This repository contains the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the **Set Cover Problem (SCP)**, an NP-hard optimization problem where the objective is to cover a universe of elements using the minimum number of subsets.

## Problem Statement

Given a universe of elements and a collection of subsets, the goal is to find the smallest combination of subsets that covers all elements in the universe.

## Solution Overview

The solution leverages a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to find near-optimal solutions. The GA workflow involves:

- **Population Initialization**: A random set of individuals representing potential solutions (subset selections).
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Individuals are evaluated based on their subset count and universe coverage.
- **Selection**: Fitter individuals are more likely to be selected for crossover.
- **Crossover & Mutation**: New individuals are generated by combining parent solutions and introducing random mutations for diversity.
- **Elitism**: Top-performing individuals are preserved across generations.
- **Termination**: The algorithm runs for a set number of generations or until convergence.
